# Moderator-Bot

![acastro_210129_1777_discord_0001](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/128980327/232897633-92ca2eaa-42e3-4b1b-8378-eb8487806f67.jpg)

We'll be using the Python programming language and the Discord.py library. This bot will be able to:

* Respond to commands from users
* Monitor the chat for rule violations
* Warn users about their behavior
* Ban or kick users who violate the rules

# Here is an example code: disty.py


This code sets up the bot and adds three commands: `!ping`, `!kick`, and `!ban`. The `!ping` command simply responds with "Pong!" when called. The `!kick` and `!ban` commands kick or ban the specified user, respectively, and send a message confirming the action.

The `on_message` event is also used to monitor the chat for rule violations. In this example, if a message starts with `!rules`, the bot responds with a reminder to follow the rules.

Note that the `has_permissions` decorator is used to restrict the `!kick` and `!ban` commands to users who have the necessary permissions. You can modify this to suit your specific needs.

Before running the bot, you'll need to replace TOKEN with your bot's `token`, which you can obtain from the Discord Developer Portal. You'll also need to add your bot to a server to test it out.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
